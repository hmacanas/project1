function [ E_low, E_high ] = energyUsed()

% Function to calculate energy used by spacecraft operations over some
% period
% Assumes low cost receiving is only on when transmitting, and high
% cost receiving is always one
%
%
% Inputs    t_transmit: time the sapcecraft is transmitting [s]
%           t_science: time spacecraft is collecting science [s]
%           t_eclipse: time spacecraft is in eclipse [s]
%           period: total time of interest [s]
% Outputs   E: total energy used including margin [W-hr]
%           E_transmit: energy used by the during transmit [W-hr]
%           E_eclipse: energy used by the during eclipse [W-hr]

% Example usage
% energyUsed(15*60, T, 45*60*10, T*11)
% where T is lunar orbit period
%       (15*60) seconds of transmitting
%       (45*60)*(10periods) seconds of non-science eclipse
%       (T*11periods) seconds total for time span of interest
